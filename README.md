## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling developers to build fast and scalable server-side applications. It is event-driven and non-blocking, making it ideal for data-intensive real-time applications.

## Core Modules

Node.js comes with a set of core modules that provide essential functionality without requiring any external dependencies. Some of the core modules I've explored include:

- **fs (File System):** For interacting with the file system (reading, writing, updating files).
- **http:** For creating web servers and handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **path:** For handling and transforming file paths.
- **os:** For getting information about the operating system.

## Local Modules

Local modules are custom modules that you create to organize your code. These modules are files or folders in your project that export specific functionalities, making your code more modular and easier to manage.






Built-in Modules
Node.js also comes with several built-in modules, which are part of its standard library. These modules provide various functionalities, such as:

crypto: For handling cryptography (hashing, encryption, etc.).
stream: For working with streaming data.
util: For various utility functions.
npm (Node Package Manager)
npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows you to install, update, and manage dependencies in your project. npm also provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools.

Basic commands:

npm init: Initializes a new Node.js project and creates a package.json file.
npm install <package>: Installs a package and adds it to your node_modules folder.
npm start: Runs the script defined in the start property of package.json.
nodemon
Nodemon is a tool that automatically restarts your Node.js application when file changes in the directory are detected. It's especially useful during development to avoid manually restarting the server every time you make changes.

Installation:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g nodemon
Usage:

bash
Copy code
nodemon app.js
package.json
The package.json file is the heart of any Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, version, and more. Here's an example of a basic package.json file:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "my-nodejs-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js application",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
Event Loop
The event loop is a core concept in Node.js, responsible for handling asynchronous operations. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations by offloading tasks to the operating system whenever possible.

Key phases of the event loop:

Timers: Executes callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() and setInterval().
Pending Callbacks: Executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.
Idle, Prepare: Internal operations used by Node.js.
Poll: Retrieves new I/O events, executing I/O-related callbacks.
Check: Executes callbacks from setImmediate().
Close Callbacks: Handles close events like socket.on('close', ...).
Events
Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, where objects (called "emitters") emit named events that cause EventListener objects to be executed. The events module allows you to create, emit, and handle custom events in your application.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on('event', () => {
    console.log('An event occurred!');
});

myEmitter.emit('event');
Conclusion
Node.js is a versatile platform with a rich ecosystem. By understanding core modules, the event loop, npm, and other tools, I'm building a solid foundation for developing efficient, scalable applications. Stay tuned as I continue to explore more advanced topics in Node.js!
